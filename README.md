# ATK – Architecture Toolkit (Cloud Decision Logic Kit)

ATK is a cloud-agnostic decision logic kit.
It uses a master cross-reference catalog of cloud services and capabilities,
validated and built through CI/CD, to generate static decision artifacts.

Humans edit only /data.
Everything else is generated.
